🚀 Overview

Trishokti Hunter V3 is an advanced browser reconnaissance tool designed for automated URL logging. Unlike traditional extensions, it utilizes Active Injection (Content Scripts) and History API Hooks to detect video streams on Single Page Applications (SPAs) like YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels without requiring page reloads.

This tool acts as the "Eyes" of the Trishokti Cyber Suite, feeding data into the "Both Downloader" engine for mass archival.

🔥 Key Features

Active Spy Agent: Injects a lightweight script to monitor URL changes every 1000ms.

Multi-Platform Support:

YouTube (Videos & Shorts)

Facebook (Watch, Reels)

Instagram (Reels, Posts)

TikTok

Passive & Active Modes: Automatically logs links or allows "Force Grab" via manual override.

Batch Processing: Auto-exports data into .txt files after collecting 50 links.

Memory Management: Auto-clears storage after successful export to prevent bloat.
